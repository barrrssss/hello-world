My first GitHub repository

About me, I'm a novice Java developer.
As student in KhPI I parcipicated in automaticly system of harvesting selection (for metalworking) project. In this project I developed MySQL database of Euronorm standart bars where user can give what he need by any parameter. That was very interesting for me.
